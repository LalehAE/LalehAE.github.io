        <h1>Autonomous ETL & Data Analytics</h1>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The Autonomous ETL & Data Analytics project is designed to streamline the utilization of corporate data, particularly for businesses that operate on complex platforms like SAP or possess extensive data archives. This solution is tailored to empower companies by circumventing the intricacies of database knowledge, enabling swift access to vital data insights.</p>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>At the core of this project lies an innovative approach leveraging AI agents developed with OpenAI and LangChain technologies. These agents function by interpreting business queries input by users. Utilizing metadata, they autonomously determine the pertinent tables and columns containing the required information. Subsequently, this metadata is incorporated into a dynamically generated prompt, which, in turn, creates a Python script tailored to execute the data analysis and procure results. The ensuing data is then channeled through another prompt that judiciously recommends optimal data visualizations for the frontend display. Moreover, the results are further analyzed to generate profound business insights and strategic advice, thus facilitating informed decision-making.</p>
        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>By automating the data extraction and analysis process, this project not only expedites the information retrieval process but also enhances the decision-making caliber of businesses. It allows companies to leverage their existing data assets more effectively and fosters a data-driven culture without the prerequisite of in-depth data warehousing expertise.</p>
