## About Me
<div style="text-align: justify;">

I care about responsible, transparent AI: systems that show where their answers come from, respect data boundaries, and keep specialists in control of decisions.

I’m Laleh, a Lead Data Scientist who designs AI solutions around complex data where accuracy and trust matter. I have led data and AI work across e-learning, procurement, manufacturing, and, most recently, geotechnical engineering in Canada.

In my most recent role as Lead Data Scientist at TREK Geotechnical in Winnipeg, I led the company’s AI and data modernization roadmap. Instead of putting a chatbot on top of messy legacy files, I designed and implemented a new data foundation that used AI, including language models, to clean and consolidate thousands of historical geotechnical files into a structured Postgres/PostGIS database, and exposed them through a Google Earth view with location-accuracy flags and a feedback loop so engineers and managers could review and correct critical records. On top of that foundation I designed a secure conversational layer over the enterprise database so geotechnical engineers and researchers could ask multi-step questions in natural language, see results on the map, download KMZ and CSV outputs, and understand which data, filters, and reasoning were used in each answer, while raw data stayed safely inside company systems.

My best work happens between domain experts, product, and engineering: listening to how people really work, clarifying the problem, shaping the data and AI approach, and guiding it into something teams trust and actually use.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Empowering businesses to harness their data effortlessly, this project utilizes AI agents created with OpenAI and LangChain to navigate complex databases, like SAP, without requiring deep database knowledge. It features an innovative AI-driven system that interprets user queries, identifies relevant data, and autonomously generates Python scripts for analysis. The system further advises on visualization and business insights, streamlining decision-making and fostering a culture of data-driven intelligence.

<img align="left" width="150" height="150" src="images/Aircraft.png"> **[Aircraft Turnaround](https://LalehAE.github.io/pages/Aircraft.html)**
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Innovating airport operations, this application empowers airline managers with real-time monitoring of aircraft turnaround. It uses advanced computer vision and a Yolo model to analyze CCTV footage, annotate events, and present live dashboards via Azure, reducing delays and enhancing efficiency.

<img align="left" width="150" height="150" src="images/Items.png"> **[Procurement Item Classification](https://LalehAE.github.io/pages/Items.html)**
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I developed a Catboost model to classify procurement invoices into more than 30 distinct categories, achieving a macro-average accuracy of 86%. This classification facilitates direct spend analysis, uncovering hidden costs and ensuring spend accuracy, which is vital for creating cost-saving procurement strategies. Additionally, I optimized the existing post-processing procedure, cutting down its runtime by 30%, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the procurement process.

<img align="left" width="150" height="150" src="images/Content.png"> **[Content Recommender Engine](https://LalehAE.github.io/pages/Content.html)**
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Developed a multilingual content recommender engine using TensorFlow Recommenders (TFRS), fine-tuned with Kubeflow and managed by an Apache Airflow pipeline on GCP. Enhanced the system to support 105 languages, improving the scope and inclusivity of user recommendations. Optimized the recommendation filtering process, ensuring users only receive current and relevant content. Future developments include A/B testing to evaluate user engagement and further refine the recommendation algorithm.

<img align="left" width="150" height="150" src="images/Social.png"> **[Social Media Recommender Engine](https://LalehAE.github.io/pages/Social.html)**
<div style="text-align: justify;">

A cutting-edge POC that transforms social connectivity by leveraging deep learning to analyze user data and match profiles with shared interests and goals. The innovative use of LaBSE for vector embeddings and cosine similarity scores significantly outperforms traditional clustering, readying the system for expansion to a broader user base.
