## About Me
<div style="text-align: justify;">

Hello! I'm Laleh, a passionate data scientist with a focus on machine learning and AI. My journey in data science is underscored by a foundation in mathematics and executive management, where leveraging data for decision-making and insight discovery is at the core of what I do.

A unique and memorable moment in my professional journey was when my manager, Zach, presented me with a piece of art as a Valentine's gift. More than a thoughtful gesture, this artwork used the VALENTINE alphabet to encapsulate qualities he saw in me, qualities that I strive to embody in my professional and personal interactions:
</div>

- **Valued for counsel**: What should I do?
- **Attend to our need**: We all need ...
- **Loves the students**:  I am so proud
- **Enjoy a challenge**: That sounds difficult. Let me ...
- **No sub-par work, ever**: This is not up to our standard
- **Truth to stupid**: You are wrong. Here is why ...
- **Infectious laughter**: HA HA HA HA HA
- **Noble Patience**: You will get there
- **Earnest**: Let me share my feelings

<img align="left" width="100" height="130" src="images/zach_thumbnail.png"> [Zach's Artwork for Laleh](images/zach.png) _"Valentine Alphabet for Laleh," a creative expression of the traits that I bring to my professional endeavors._

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Each of these attributes, represented through Zach's creative lens, highlights the blend of technical expertise, leadership, and interpersonal skills I bring to the field of data science. It's a reminder of the impact we can have through our work, the value of clear communication and empathy, and the importance of maintaining a positive, earnest approach in all our endeavors.

<img align="left" width="150" height="150" src="images/GenAI.png"> **[Autonomous ETL & Data Analytics](https://LalehAE.github.io/pages/GenAI.html)**
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Empowering businesses to harness their data effortlessly, this project utilizes AI agents created with OpenAI and LangChain to navigate complex databases, like SAP, without requiring deep database knowledge. It features an innovative AI-driven system that interprets user queries, identifies relevant data, and autonomously generates Python scripts for analysis. The system further advises on visualization and business insights, streamlining decision-making and fostering a culture of data-driven intelligence.
